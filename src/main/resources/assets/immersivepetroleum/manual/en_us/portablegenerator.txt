Portable Generator
Gassed Up
<&portablegenerator0>
Portable Generators are a easily-movable light fuel combustion generator alternate to the heavy, immobile <link;immersiveengineering:diesel_generator;§n§oDiesel Generator§r>. The generator connects to LV and MV power grids directly, and can be picked up with it contents by crouching.<np>
The Portable Generator produces up to <config;i;portablegenerator_flux> IF/t while burning fuels such as <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§ogasoline§r;gasoline>, <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§onaphtha§r;naphtha>, or <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§obenzene§r;naphtha_derivates>, and has an energy buffer of 100,000IF.

The Portable Generator can accept fuel from buckets and jerrycans, and will accept fuel piped into the fuel input port on top of the generator.

Higher quality fuels will last longer, and a redstone signal will immediately halt the generator with no lost fuel.
