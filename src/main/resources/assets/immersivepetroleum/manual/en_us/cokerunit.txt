Coker
Very Sticky Stuff
<&cokerunit0>The Coker is a massive machine that cracks and carbonizes residual <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§obitumen§r;bitumen> from distillation into <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§opetroleum coke§r;petroleum_coke> and <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§osulfurized §n§odiesel§r;diesel>.

Energy is input through the two high-amperage connectors on the front of the machine, and bitumen and water to the two labeled input ports on the front of the machine. Sulfurized diesel is output from the output port on the front, and petroleum coke from the two hoppers beneath the coking drums.

Supplying a redstone signal to the control panel will halt the coking process, which can be inverted with the use of the Engineer's Screwdriver.

Due to the heating-cooling cycle of the coking process, the Coker is an energy-intensive machine that requires medium or high voltage infrastructure.

To construct the machine, build it as shown and use the Engineer's Hammer on the concrete block in the center on the side with the redstone engineering block.<np>
The coking process is as followed: bitumen is loaded into the coking drums. Once the coking drums are full, the drums are brought up to temperature and the bitumen is converted into petroleum coke and sulfurized diesel. When the conversion is complete, the drums are drained of sulfurized diesel, then dumped and flushed with water to cool down for the bitumen to be loaded again.<np>
The coking drums do not need to be filled up for the coking process to begin, and more bitumen can be input during the first phase of the coking cycle. Once the output and flushing phases have begun, more bitumen cannot be input until the cycle completes.

Once the currently filling drum is full of bitumen, bitumen will be input to the other coking drum until it is full.
