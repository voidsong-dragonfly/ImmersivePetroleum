Petroleum Products
At Least It's Not GT5u
<&crude>
Crude Oil is a sticky, black substance that seeps from <link;immersivepetroleum:reservoir;§n§oreservoirs§r> in the world. It is the base resource that all other petroleum-based resources take their feedstock from, and is essential to any petrochemical engineer's journey.

Crude oil can be separated in the <link;immersivepetroleum:distillationtower;§n§oDistillation Tower§r> once it is extracted from reservoirs.
<&lubricant>
Lubricant is the heaviest fraction immediately distillable from <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oCrude Oil§r;crude>, and is best used to lubricate machines to high efficiency.

It can be burned in the flare stack if such activities are not useful.
<&diesel>
Diesel and Sulfurized Diesel are the heavyweight fuels of the petrochemical engineer, being able to be used in the <link;immersiveengineering:diesel_generator;§n§oDiesel Generator§r> for bulk power production.

Sulfurized Diesel can be used for an easy source of sulfur, and is the second-heaviest fraction distillable from <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oCrude Oil§r;crude>.
<&gasoline>
Gasoline is a light fuel suitable for the <link;immersivepetroleum:portablegenerator;§n§oPortable Generator§r> or <link;immersivepetroleum:speedboat;§n§oMotorboat§r>, and can also be used in <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oNapalm§r;napalm>.

It is the third-heaviest fraction distillable from <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oCrude Oil§r;crude>, and unlike its lighter sister <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oNaphtha§r;naphtha>, gasoline is unusable as a chemical feedstock.
<&naphtha>
Naphtha is a light fuel suitable for the <link;immersivepetroleum:portablegenerator;§n§oPortable Generator§r> or <link;immersivepetroleum:speedboat;§n§oMotorboat§r>, and the lightest fraction distillable from <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oCrude Oil§r;crude>.

Naphtha is the perfect chemical feedstock for producing plastics, and is most often used to produce <link;immersiveengineering:plastic;§n§oPhenolic Resin§r> from its <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oderivates§r;naphtha_derivates>.
<&naphtha_derivates>
Benzene, Propylene, and Ethylene are not immediately distillable from crude oil, these lighter feedstocks must be distilled from <link;immersivepetroleum:plastics;§n§ocracked naphtha§r;plastics1>.

Benzene can be used as light fuel, but propylene and ethylene are gasses, and cannot. All three are used as chemical feedstock for <link;immersiveengineering:plastic;§n§oPhenolic Resin§r>.
<&napalm>
Napalm is an extremely flammable substance that can be created in the <link;mixer;§n§oMixer§r> using <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oGasoline§r;gasoline> and three measures of Aluminium Grit. It has little use other than wanton destruction; when Napalm is lit, fire will spread almost immediately over its surface, allowing for rapid deforestation. In addition, it can serve as a very effective fuel for the <link;chemthrower;§n§oChemthrower§r>.
