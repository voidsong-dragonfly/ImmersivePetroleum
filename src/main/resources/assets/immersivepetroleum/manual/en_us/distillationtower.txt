Distillation Tower
Environmentally unfriendly
<&distillationtower0>The Distillation Tower is a large multiblock structure that separates crude oil into a number of byproducts.<np>
It is built as shown and formed by using the Engineering's Hammer on the Redstone Engineering Block.

Applying a redstone signal to the control panel will halt the machine's process, this behavior can be inverted by use of the Screwdriver.

Crude Oil can be input into the Distillation Tower at the back hatch marked with a blue dot, where it will be heated until it separates into a number of layers. This produces a variety of fluids and has a chance to produce Bitumen as a byproduct.

The Distillation Tower uses <config;i;distillationtower_operationcost> Flux per operation, converting up to 75 mB of Crude Oil to 9mB Lubricant, 36mB Sulfurized Diesel, 20mB Gasoline, 10mB Naphtha, and some Bitumen per tick. The produced fluid mix is output from the side hatch marked with an orange dot; the Bitumen through the front hatch.<np>
A secondary recipe of the distillation tower is to convert 10mB of <link;immersivepetroleum:hydrotreater;§o§nCracked Naptha§r> to 2mB Benzene, 2mB Propylene, and 6mB Ethylene. Fluids are output equivalently to crude oil.

Diesel can be used for <link;diesel_generator;§o§npower §o§nproduction§r>; Lubricant for <link;immersivepetroleum:lubricant;§o§noiling §o§nmachines§r>; Gasoline for <link;immersivepetroleum:portablegenerator;§o§npowering §o§nengines§r>, <link;immersivepetroleum:speedboat;§o§nvehicles§r> or <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§o§nNapalm§r;napalm>; and Naphtha for <link;immersivepetroleum:portablegenerator;§o§npowering §o§nengines§r> or <link;immersivepetroleum:plastics;§o§nplastics§r>. Bitumen is used to make <link;immersivepetroleum:asphalt;§o§nAsphalt§r> and can be processed to get Petroleum Coke in the <link;immersivepetroleum:cokerunit;§o§nCoker§r>.
